    <p class="muted">
      This Privacy Policy describes how YouTube Streamer (“we”, “our”, “us”) handles information when
      you visit our website, create an account, or use our streaming services. This page is a general
      template and should be adapted with your actual practices and local legal requirements.
    </p>

      <li>Usage data such as pages visited, actions taken in the dashboard, and device information.</li>
      <li>Content you upload for streaming (video, audio, thumbnails, and related metadata).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide, operate, and maintain your Streamloop account.</li>
      <li>Process subscription payments and manage your plan.</li>
      <li>Monitor and support your live streams and service performance.</li>
      <li>Communicate important updates, security alerts, and support messages.</li>
      <li>Improve and analyze platform performance and user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cookies and tracking technologies</h2>
    <p>
      We may use cookies and similar technologies to remember your preferences, keep you signed in,
      and understand how you interact with the site. You can control cookies through your browser
      settings, but blocking them may impact certain features.

    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information to third parties in exchange for money. If you engage
      with third‑party platforms such as YouTube, their own policies apply to those services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information for as long as necessary to provide the service, comply with legal
      obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Streaming media and logs may be

      information, or to object to specific processing. You can contact us using the details in the
      “Contact us” section to make a request.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use technical and organizational safeguards that are designed to protect your information
      from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. No online service can guarantee perfect security,
      so you should also keep your account credentials safe and unique.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be revised
      when changes are posted. Your continued use of YouTube Streamer after an update means you
      accept the revised policy.
