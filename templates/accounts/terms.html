    <p class="muted">
      These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”) form a binding agreement between you and YouTube
      Streamer. By creating an account or using the service, you agree to these Terms. This template
      is a general example and should be customized with your specific legal requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Use of the service</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to use StreamLoop only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all
      applicable laws, YouTube policies, and any other third‑party terms that apply to your content
      and streams.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for the content you upload and stream.</li>
      <li>You must not use the service to infringe copyrights or other rights.</li>
      <li>You must not attempt to disrupt, overload, or reverse‑engineer the platform.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accounts and subscriptions</h2>
    <p>
      To access paid features, you may need to create an account and purchase a subscription plan
      such as a one‑day, monthly, or annual plan. You are responsible for maintaining the security of
      your login credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subscription features, limits, and pricing are described in the plan details on the site. Plan
      changes, renewals, and cancellations may be subject to additional terms presented during
      checkout.
    </p>

    <h2>Payments and refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed through third‑party payment providers. By submitting payment details,
      you authorize us and our payment partners to charge the applicable fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any refund policy will be described on the pricing or checkout pages. Where refunds are not
      explicitly offered, all charges are generally non‑refundable except where required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>Content and intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      You retain ownership of the content you upload and stream through YouTube Streamer. You grant
      us a limited, non‑exclusive license to process and transmit that content solely for the purpose
      of providing the service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The YouTube Streamer platform, including its software, design, and branding, is protected by
      intellectual property laws and may not be copied, modified, or redistributed without
      permission.
    </p>

    <h2>Service availability</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to keep the platform available and stable, but uptime is not guaranteed. Maintenance,
      updates, and third‑party outages may affect your ability to stream or access your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, YouTube Streamer is not liable for indirect, incidental,
      or consequential damages arising from your use of the service, including lost revenue, lost
      viewers, or data loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we are found to have any liability, it will be limited to the amount you paid for the
      service over a recent period defined in your specific plan terms or local law.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. The “Last updated” date will be revised when
      changes are posted. If you continue to use the service after the changes take effect, you agree
      to the updated Terms.
